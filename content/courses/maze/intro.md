## Goal:
The goal of this course is to complete two programs:
1. A hexadecimal maze generator
2. An optimized solver to find the shortest path from start to finish

## Topics:
This course will teach you some basics of data structures and algorithms. We will also be covering the topics of debugging, visualizing and testing automation for complex programs.

Data Structures:
1. Linked Lists
2. Queue
3. Disjoint-sets

Algorithms:
1. Union-Find
2. Breadth First Search
